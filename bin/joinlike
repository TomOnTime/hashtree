#	joinlike combines all lines that have the same `first' part
#	where the first part is defined to be everything to the first whitespace #
#	The behaviour is somewhat akin to join, but it doesn't assume
#	the input is sorted, works within a file (or piped into)
#
#	NOTE: this will join lines between and within files
